 * Created by devinmcgloin on 1/25/16.
 * Sequence that switches between sets lists and queues depending on the action called.
 * Sorting makes the Seq take list form, and ranking produces a Queue.
 * - Note these changes are internal to Seq, and are not apparent to the outside user.
 * <p>
 * Seq also allows for map, filter, reduce operations, as well as grouping by a field, and getting subsets.
